# ChatHat
Whatsapp inspired, real time mobile chat app

This App is created using Expo, React-Native, AWS Amplify and GraphQL.

### Installation

#

Clone repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/penao7/ChatHat.git
```

Lastly, In order to get the app work you have to provide your own aws-exports.js, which is generated by AWS amplify, to the root folder of the app.

Run 

```bash
$ amplify env add 
```

and set up a new environment (e.g. “mydev”) with that developer’s account and AWS profile

Deploy with 

```bash
$ amplify push
```
More information can be found from AWS Amplify official [documentation](https://gist.github.com/dabit3/51d5eef5a01f1c47e645c17b1af430f4).

## Features

User can sign up and sign in, find all authenticated users from the contact list and start conversations which will appear real time in their chatlist.

## Todos

There was some kind of bug when receiving onCreateMessage subscription that resetted messages in the state, but this has been workarounded by fetching messages again rather than appending messages in the state.

Status tab for real-time user status change

Some kind of feed for thoughts
